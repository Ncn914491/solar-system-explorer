Despite being closest to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet - that title goes to Venus. Mercury has no atmosphere to retain heat, so temperatures swing wildly from 430°C during the day to -180°C at night. Its surface is heavily cratered, much like our Moon, showing billions of years of impacts. Mercury orbits the Sun faster than any other planet, completing a year in just 88 Earth days.",
